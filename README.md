# CSC177 Project 2: Linear Regression and Classification Tree Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for our Linear Regression and Classification Tree Project. We explored various datasets, applied linear regression models, and constructed classification trees to gain insights and make predictions.

## Project Overview
In this project, we tackled two major tasks: linear regression and classification tree construction. We applied these techniques to different datasets to analyze and predict relationships between variables.

### Part A: Linear Regression
- Explored and preprocessed a dataset related to weather.
- Split the data into training and test sets.
- Implemented simple and multiple linear regression models.
- Analyzed the relationships between temperature and humidity.

### Part B: Classification Tree
- Built a classification tree based on provided data.
- Calculated entropy and information gain for attributes.
- Constructed a decision tree with color, size, and shape as nodes.
- Discussed the impact of adding a new attribute to the tree.

To explore each part of the project, navigate to the corresponding directory/ file and follow the instructions provided in the README or documentation.
